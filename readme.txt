== Description ==

It's the same oEmbed functionality you know and love from Posts, but now enabled for Comments!

* YouTube
* Vimeo

* DailyMotion
* Hulu
* Soundcloud
* Spotify
* Facebook

When the comment is posted and approved, the URL automagically transforms into the embedded content.

#### What is oEmbed ####

[oEmbed](http://www.oembed.com/) is a simple API that allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource.  It was designed to avoid copying and pasting HTML from the media you wish to embed.
